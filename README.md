# Welcome to the Telegram bot system.

## Two programmers worked on the project and developed its first version

[maxwell882000](https://github.com/maxwell882000) and [Ruzimurod2003](https://github.com/Ruzimurod2003)

The assignment consists of 3 parts:

1. The back end part of the assignment. For this part, an ASP NET Core Web Api project was written and configured to release the Api in its entirety,
2. For the other part, a React App project was created, in which the complete view of the quiz was configured with all the necessary settings, views and properties.
3. The logic of transferring the commands received by the bot to the view form or to another place is made

Then it goes through each page, determines the test, and the back end waits for the result and stores it in the database,
